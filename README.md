# A-Research-on-factors-affecting-house-pricing-on-the-real-estate.

Defining the Question
The research problem is to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months and  create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables. 

b) Defining the Metric for Success This project will be successful when: We come up with a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables

2)The model achieves atleast 80% accuracy

3)Have the lowest RMSE score possible

c) Understanding the context

d)Experimental Design

The project was undertaken using the following design Datasets(housing_dataset)

Cleaning datasets

Performing EDA

Feature Engineering

Multiple Linear Regression

Ridge regression

Lasso Regression

Elastic Regrssion

Computing the RMSE

Plotting residual plots

Assess their heteroscedasticity using Barlette's test
